## 💡 About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast blending the worlds of **cloud engineering**, **machine learning**, and **bioinformatics**. With hands-on experience in both research and production-grade systems, I thrive on building scalable infrastructure, automating data workflows, and delivering actionable insights.

Previously worked as a **Cloud Engineer III**, where I led full-scale **Azure and AWS migration projects**, secured infrastructure, and deployed resilient cloud solutions. I'm currently exploring ML applications in **genomics**, **time series forecasting**, and **precise psychiatry**.
